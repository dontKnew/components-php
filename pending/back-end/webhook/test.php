<p>In addition to the weight of the package, the dimensions of the package also play a role in determining the courier charges. <?=ucwords($charges['serivce_name'])?> Courier considers both the length and width of the package, and packages that exceed the maximum allowed dimensions may incur additional charges. To avoid any additional charges, it's important to ensure that your package does not exceed the maximum dimensions specified by <?=ucwords($charges['serivce_name'])?> Courier</p>
<p>The shipping destination is another important factor that determines the courier charges. <?=ucwords($charges['serivce_name'])?> Courier charges higher for packages shipped to remote areas, as the delivery costs are higher in these regions.

The charges for these options vary, with express delivery attracting the highest charges and standard delivery attracting the lowest charges.
