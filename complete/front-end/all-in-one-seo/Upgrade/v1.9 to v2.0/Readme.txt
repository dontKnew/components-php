Note: 

i) Backup your files and database before upgrade! 

ii) This upgrade have major changes on complete script files. So you're theme customizations will be lost 
and old v1 addons can't work. (Need to re-download latest addon patches and install the addons again.)


Updation Steps:

1. After backup, delete the files except "config.php" and "uploads" directory. 

2. Using your Server FTP or File Manager access, upload the files present at below directory: 
"/Upgrade/v1.9 to v2.0/Upload/*"

3. After successful file upload, just visit the "index.php" (homepage) link on your browser and complete the updation process.

4. Setup the Cron Job (Refer doumenation for instruction)

You have done the work!
