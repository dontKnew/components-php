Download ngrok from their website: https://ngrok.com/download.

Extract the downloaded file and open a terminal/command prompt in the extracted folder.

Start your XAMPP server and make sure that your website is accessible at http://localhost or http://localhost:<port> (replace <port> with the port number of your web server, if applicable).

In the terminal, run the following command to start ngrok:

php
Copy code
ngrok http <port>
Replace <port> with the port number of your web server. If you are using the default port 80, you can omit the port number.

Ngrok will generate a unique URL that you can share with your client. The URL will look something like https://abcdefg.ngrok.io.

Share the URL with your client and they should be able to access your website from anywhere.
